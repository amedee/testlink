<p>Recent Update: 12 Jan 2012: Hi All,</p>

<p>Thanks to those who helped other readers overcome their issues with this macro. I am now going to work on troubleshooting tips and also upgrading this macro. So, please keep following this blog and go through the comments (there are so many helpful comments) if you have any issues with this macro.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<hr><p>I have created an excel template with macro to generate xml for importing requirements/test cases/test suites to testlink. This macro will generate two xml files - one for requirement (excel sheet name_Req.xml) and oen for test cases (excel sheet name_Tc.xml)</p>
